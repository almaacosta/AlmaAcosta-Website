        <p class="lead mb-4">Currently, I am 20 years old, enrolled at UCR working towards a Masters in Sociology. Customer Service employee who excels at meeting customer needs, finding solutions and handling objections. Top performer when it comes to meeting and exceeding goals. Friendly one who consistently meets customer service satisfaction and courteous at all times. More efficiently, as a member of an organization in which its ambition is assisting the youth in educational courses. I have excelled in communication and behavior with children. From educational event planning up to personal tutoring, the task has been over shined efficiently.

<br><br>My professional work experience started in 2018 when I applied to become a beauty advisor at L‚ÄôOccitane en Provence. My work ethics excelled as the days went by. I had the opportunity to become the store event coordinator outside of the boutique which required me to develop many skills such as organization and expanding my creativity. I coordinated three outdoor events at a local street fair in Palm Desert, CA. Throughout this event, myself and a coworker promoted the company's finest products, demonstrated demos, and enrolled customers to our rewards program. The main focus of these events were not necessarily to sell products, yet inform those who have not heard of the company and invite them over to our boutique. Aside from outdoor events we had a wide variety of ‚Äúparties‚Äù inside the boutique. These parties were known to gather groups for special events such as brunch, birthdays, and any special celebration. As a whole team, we would treat all guests with a pampered spa treatment and provide all beverages and deserts. Working at L‚ÄôOccitane gave me the opportunity to work with customer service and a team. This job was beyond just selling products, it taught me so much about caring for others and being very informative due to the fact that our customers came to us for their skin concerns ranging from their face to their feet. This experience has made me become more of an outspoken person and encouraged me to peek out of my shell, making me feel more confident. 

<br><br>Throughout my last year of high school I volunteered for LifeSteps.co to assist elementary school students with their homework and tutoring those who need help. I was assigned the duty of a teacher's assistant in which I had to start the class up with a small lecture and activity while the instructor finished paperwork. After the teacher took control my responsibility was to observe the children and make sure they understood the material. If needed reassurance, typically the teacher or I would step in as a tutor. This program has taught me patience and provided me with the experience of being hands on with children. This experience was a great starting point to my future career. My plans are to graduate by 2022 with my Bachelors then continue my education for a Master‚Äôs in Sociology and begin my career with social work. Eventually, I will move up the ladder to become what I desire to be, clinical child psychologist.<br><br>
